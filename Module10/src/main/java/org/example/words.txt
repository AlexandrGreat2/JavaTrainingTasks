3. JSON in Java [package org.json]
The JSON - Java library also known as org.json (not to be confused with Google’s org.json.simple) provides us with classes that are used to parse and manipulate JSON in Java.
Furthermore, this library can also convert between JSON, XML, HTTP Headers, Cookies, Comma Delimited List or Text, etc.
In this tutorial, we’ll have a look at the following classes:
JSONObject – similar to Java’s native Map-like object, which stores unordered key-value pairs
JSONArray – an ordered sequence of values similar to Java’s native Vector implementation
JSONTokener – a tool that breaks a piece of text into a series of tokens that can be used by JSONObject or JSONArray to parse JSON strings
CDL – a tool that provides methods to convert comma delimited text into a JSONArray and vice versa
Cookie – converts from JSON String to cookies and vice versa
HTTP – used to convert from JSON String to HTTP headers and vice versa
JSONException – a standard exception thrown by this library
